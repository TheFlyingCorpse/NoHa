Notification Handler for Icinga / Nagios / Centreon / Shinken
=============================================================

What is NoHa
------------

NoHa is an alternative way to handle notifications sent from your nagios based monitoring system. The goal of the project is to make it easy to filter notifications to contacts based on rules with conditions that must be met for the rule to be valid.

Requirements
------------
Python requirements:
* pyYAML (OpenSuSE: python-yaml)

Features
--------
* Can sort based on input on-demand with hardcoded conditions in the ruleeval.py file.
* Client and Server, where client sends the messages over XML-RPC to the Server for processing.

Support
-------
Logging:
* in etc/noha.yml by default, uses LogRecord attributes which can be looked up here: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes
