Future -- (not yet decided)
---------------------------
* Should daemon handle escalations?
** Socket / Pipe ?

* Complete the modularization so any program can utilize the filters offered by NoHa for notifications
* Add functionality so it will actually call notify functions
* Figure out what backend AND frontend to use, for configuration

* Time functions
** From and To within a day
** Xth day of month
** Start and End of validity
** On-Call functions
** Shift functions

* Better documentation

Far future
----------
* Encryption via socket
